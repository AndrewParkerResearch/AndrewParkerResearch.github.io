about this entirely through intuition so apologies if it's complete
bologne. Basically, the premis is what if we split up what's being
noised over time. As in, in the earlier steps of noising we're focusing
on removing the temporal structure (dynamics) of the signal but
retaining the spectral (tonal) structure (or some average of it). Then
later in the schedule, once the temporal strcuture has been removed
(noised), the tonal strucutre is removed. In this sense, you're
compartmentalising the denoising process. So at the beginning of the
denoising the net is focused on finding a broad spectral profile, then
it moves onto sculpting the dominant dynamic variation, then finally
fills that dynamic variation in with what's causing it. I likened this
yesterday in a conversation with Zach and CJ to uncovering ruins from
under water, vs uncovering ruins by digging them up. If you drain water
from the ruins you only find the smallest pieces once nearly all the
water has gone. But, if you're digging away at sand you're more likely
to find the smaller bits earlier, because you're not going to try and
dust off the second story walls when there's still sand covering the
first story. But, maybe this is nonsense! Even if this can't be used as
is, maybe it'll inspire something else</pre><!--/introduction--><pre>Starting off with the following reference track for the sake of example</pre><pre class="codeinput">rng(3); <span class="comment">% seed random for sake of plots being consistant</span>
