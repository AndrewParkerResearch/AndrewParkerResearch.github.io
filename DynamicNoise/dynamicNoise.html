  </style></head><body><div class="content"><h1></h1><!--introduction--><pre>Here's an alternative noisisng scheme I thought might yeild some
interesting results. Here, the signal dynamics are taken into account
and early in the noise schedule, the signal dynamics are used to shape
the added noise signal. As the schedule moves on, the signal dynamic's
influence reduces to nothing, such that T=1 is the same gaussian noise
as in the more convential scheme. This has the result of maintaining a
more consistant signal to noise ratio between quiet and loud parts of
the signal at mid and early points in the schedule, with the hope of
reducing the performance bias towards louder signals. This is an attempt
at addressing the same issue as the compansion method discussed in
lonewater.github.io/Emphasis/. This noise scheme could be a replacement
for, or used in conjunction with compansion.
The hope of using this dynamically influenced noising scheme is that the
model will learn dynamic variation in the signals in middle and later
time steps without worrying about any signals timbre. In middle and
earlier timesteps, once the dynamic profile of the sound has been
established, the timbre of louder and quieter sounds will be determined
simultaniously, preventing louder sounds' timbre being focused on prior
to quieter sounds.</pre><!--/introduction--><pre>Read in test example drum break as it's an example with good dynamic
